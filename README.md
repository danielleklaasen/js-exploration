# JS exploration
The purpose of this repository is to take a deep dive into JS concepts and use this as a playground to experiment with code concepts.

## Structure
This is an accompanying playground while going over the concepts covered in the 'You don't know JS yet' - series. Some folders might contain more text, others more code examples, depending of origin of the subject.

## How to use this project
If you would like to play around with this code locally, follow these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/danielleklaasen/js-exploration.git

cd js-exploration

```
